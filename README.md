Description:
A Python-based project that detects stress levels using physiological data such as EDA (Electrodermal Activity) and HR (Heart Rate). A Random Forest Classifier is trained to classify data into stress or no-stress.

Features:

Preprocessing of physiological data

Train/Test split with feature scaling

Random Forest Classifier for prediction

Evaluate model accuracy and classification report

Predict stress for new user samples

Tech Stack:

Python 3

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Installation & Running:

Clone the repository: git clone <repo-url>

Ensure Python 3 and pip are installed

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script: python stress_detection.py

Sample predictions can be tested by modifying the new_sample variable in the scrip
